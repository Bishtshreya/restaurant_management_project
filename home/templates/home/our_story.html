    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to our restaurant! Founded with a passion for food and hospitality,
        we started as a small family kitchen and grew into a place where friends and
        families come together to enjoy delicious meals. Our mission has always been
        simple: to serve fresh, flavorful dishes that make you feel at home.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the years, we have perfected our recipes and built strong relationships
        with local farmers to ensure that every ingredient is of the highest quality.
        Thank you for being part of our journey-we look forward to serving you for
        many years to come.
    </p>
